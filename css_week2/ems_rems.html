    <h1>Rems vs Ems</h1>

    <h2>Ems</h2>

    <p>Ems are a multiplication of the measurement by the inherited font-size. Elements will inherit properties, such as font-size, from parent elements if no property is set for that specific element. This paragraph has a size of 20px, because the <code>html</code> element has a font-size of 20px. There is no CSS rule for paragraphs defined in this style sheet.</p> 
    
    <p>If you create an <code>h2</code> element and apply a <code>font-size: 2em;</code> CSS property, then the <code>h2</code> element will be <code>2em = 2 * 20px = 40px</code>.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 40px;">I am 40px at 100% screensize</h3>

    <p>One problem with ems, is that they <b>compound</b>. This is demonstrated by the 2 lists on the previous page. Here's another example of this:</p>

    <div>
        <span>Outer <span>inner</span> outer</span>
    </div>

    <p>Why is this happening? The <code>span</code> element has a font-size of <code>2em</code>. An nested <code>span</code> element will use the multiplier on its parent (the first <code>span</code> element in this example).</p>

    <p>So, the first span element (containing the words 'outer outer') will have a computed font size of:
        
    <p><code>2 * 20px (html font size) = 40px</code>.</p>
   
    <p>The second span will have a computed font size of:</p>
    <p><code>2 * 40px (the computed size of the first span) = 80px</code>.</p>

    <p>The <em>rem</em> unit was created to deal with this problem.</p>

    <h2>Rems</h2>
        
    <p>The <em>rem</em> measurement works on the root of the html page, the <code>html</code> element. This eliminates the <b>compounding problem</b> because the the calculation is <em>always</em> based on the font-size property of the <code>html</code> element.</p>
